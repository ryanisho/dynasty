# Dynasty 

A JavaScript based game that allows players to simulate a 1v1 fighting game using WASD and arrow keys.
## Description

Dynasty was created based on a Mortal Combat style type of game. It involves two sprites, one being player 1, and the other being player 2, to duel eachother based on the arrow and WASD keys. This game was created in JavaScript with gsap libraries for animations and CSS Tailwind platelettes for aesthetic purposes. This game is also based off a YouTube course teaching sprite design, collision, game design, and HTML canvas modeling.
